#Rebel Server
Rebel Kangaroo is a senior design project at MSOE created by a 2016-17 design team.
Rebel Server is the remote server that the micro-controller and mobile app will communicate
with. The current plan of action is to run SocketIO on top of a MEAN stack to get data
in real time, with the power of dynamic HTML and agile data storage with MonogoDB.
The project is attacking th problem of 'green' energy by designing,protoyping,developing
and testing a programmable power switch that can be controlled by a mobile app.
