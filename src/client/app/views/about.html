    <h2>Problem statement</h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost of using energy to run household devices while they are not being used is expensive and unnecessary.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>Our Solution</h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our solution is to create an affordable, efficient, compact and stylish fully programmable power strip. Each individual outlet will be controllable to limit power consumption by implementing an automated schedule or manual
    use through the interface of a personal device. The design will cost significantly less compared to the existing market by using high density plastic instead of a metal casing which results in less weight.
